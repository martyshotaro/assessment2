<h2 style="font-family:verdana">Project Idea</h2>

<h3 style="font-family:verdana">This should be a summary of what the project will be</h3>

<p style="font-family:verdana">The project that I’ve chosen is called “Mini Fling It In!” This will be made from a site called MIT app inventor. The key features of this game consist of flicking the ball to a particular area, but there are obstacles that include 2D rectangle lines and they’re immobile throughout the duration of the game in order to get the ball through to succeed and win the game. Lastly, it’s recommended for Android smartphone users since it’s more accessible to connect your Android device from your project or game through MIT app inventor, and can also be played to your computer via the emulator, located at the top of the design editor section.</p>

<h3 style="font-family:verdana">This should be a description of why the project will be interesting or useful</h3>  
  
<p style="font-family:verdana">This would be a handy and an interesting game for individuals due to the fun aspect of it even if it were just a simple game; it takes way your stress, especially if you had a long day from work, studies and etc. This app is a perfect way to relax. Lastly, another interesting part of this is the low level of complexity and difficulty of this app/game, which indicates that it can be played by anyone of any ages. Statistics show that 6.8 million people around over 190 countries have used this app inventor to create more than 24 million apps, which indicates as a good sign.</p>

<h3 style="font-family:verdana">A detailed description of the features of the product or service</h3>
  
<p style="font-family:verdana">The description of the features of MIT App Inventor includes the ability to drop/grab components to a design view and the use of visual blocks language in order to program application behaviour. It provides a web based editing for the building of apps through iOS and Android (most recommended) in terms of their operating systems. Also, it has applied a block-based programming language built by Google Blockly. It also consists of such inspirations from languages that include StarLogo TNG and Scratch, which gives users the ability to build a smartphone app for their needs to be met. The purpose of its usage is it provides the families and communities the mobile solutions to real life situations/problems. Also, it’s adaptable way to serve requirements in terms of specific populations that include making aps for emergency and first responders and robotics. Other features of this app inventor include a user interface that consists of two main editors that include design editor and blocks editor. Design editor is a drop and drag interface that blueprints the elements of the individual’s user interface (UI), whereas the blocks editor is an environment that involves where the app inventors can visibly lay out the logic of their apps through the use of color-coded blocks that would join together, just like puzzle pieces in order to demonstrate the program. Lastly, in order to assist the development and testing, MIT provides a mobile app called the App Inventor Companion, in which the developers can use to adjust and test in order to monitor the behaviour of their apps. Hence, anyone can build a mobile app and immediately start to test and recapitulate quickly.</p> 

<h3 style="font-family:verdana">Describe the software, hardware and/or other equipment needed. Include any relevant open source tools as appropriate</h3>
  
<p style="font-family:verdana">The software that are a part of this game and MIT app inventor includes inspirations from languages such as Scratch and StarLogo TNG, which gives users the ability to build a smartphone app for their needs to be met. Also, other software components include GNU/Linux (Debian 5 or higher and Ubuntu 8 or higher), Windows (Windows 7, Windows Vista, and Windows XP), and Macintosh with an Intel Processor (Mac OS X 10.5 or higher), which are all computer operating systems. 
  
<p style="font-family:verdana">Browser requirements include Mozila Firefox 3.6 or higher (if you’re using it with the NoScript extension, the extension must be turned off), Apple Safari 5.0 or higher, Google Chrome 4.0 or higher, which are mandatory for the app inventor to run successfully. However, Microsoft Internet Explorer isn’t recommended and reinforced for MIT App Inventor to run for projects and games.</p>
  
<p style="font-family:verdana">Also, one of the most important tools includes a WebViewer component. This refers to a process when javascript is being implemented in your MIT App Inventor projects that will provide users with a better foundation for more complex and handy javascript processing. Javascript is implemented for the overall complexity of advanced features of the MIT App Inventor (especially in the “Blocks” editor part of the App Inventor). The prime example of those includes four variables and three event handlers, which are in the following below:</p>
  
<p style="font-family:verdana"><b>The 4 variables:</b></p>

<p style="font-family:verdana">img src</p>
  
<p style="font-family:verdana">For the <b>“processingIntervalMillis”</b> part in the variables, it sets the repetition of calls to the WebViewer component from the App Inventor. Now this is when <b>“debugMode”</b> is being implemented. The <b>“debugMode”</b> refers to the specification of the HTML file’s location that is used by the WebViewer, as the App Inventor apps use different directories for running and developing of the apps. Now this is when the <b>“currentProcessingDurationMillis”</b> occurs. Its purpose consists of tracking the amount of milliseconds that the WebViewer has been working as it develops the javascript into the HTML file. Lastly, this is where <b>“maximumProcessingDurationMillis”</b> occurs. It refers to the control of the amount of milliseconds used by the app that will stand by for a response from the WebViewer component before the confirmation of the response being unresponsive.</p>

<p style="font-family:verdana"><b>The 3 event handlers:</b></p>

<p style="font-family:verdana">img src</p>

<p style="font-family:verdana"><b>Screen1.Initialize</b> is a block that refers to when it sets to a <em>WebViewer1.HomeUrl</em> property to files that include <u>file:///mnt/sdcard/AppInventor/assets/javascriptWebViewProcessor.html</u>. This is when <b>“debugMode”</b> is correct whereas <u>file:///android_asset/javascriptWebViewProcessor.html</u> is implemented when <b>"debugMode"</b> is incorrect. Lastly, it sets to Clock1.TimerInterval property to the value of <b>“processingIntervalMillis”</b>, which is 50 milliseconds, and it also undermines the Clock1 component, so that the triggering events are stopped for the benefit of running the app during its start.</p>

<p style="font-family:verdana">img src</p>

<p style="font-family:verdana">The <b>btnProcess.Click</b> block refers to the setting of the <em>WebViewer1.WebViewString</em> component to the value of the <em>StringToBeProceesedByJavascriptFile.Text</em>. Through this, the <em>WebViewer1.GoHome</em> procedure is called that result in the WebViewer to load the <u>javascriptWebViewProcessor.html</u> page, which starts the processing aspect of javascript. Once the javascript processing begins, the app needs to be monitored in terms of its progress, and the <em>Clock1.TimerEnabled</em> property must be labelled as “true”.
  
<p style="font-family:verdana">img src</p>  

<p style="font-family:verdana"><b>Clock1.Timer</b> refers to the firing of an intermission set by the <b>“processingIntervalMillis”</b> variable whilst being in the <b>Screen1.Initialize</b> event. This occurs when the <em>Clock1.TimerEnabled property</em> is labelled as “true”. Every time the <em>Clock1.Timer</em> event is triggered, the inventor app searches for first checks to look for the value if <em>WebViewer1.WebViewString</em> matches with the <em>StringToBeProcessedByJavascriptFile.Text</em>, which will result in the WebViewer component being in current progress by the use of javascript, which augments the <b>"currentProcessingDurationMillis"</b> by the <b>"processingIntervalMillis"</b>.</p> 

<p style="font-family:verdana">Its next step includes checking to see if the new <b>"currentProcessingDurationMillis"</b> has a preeminent value, or equivalent to the <b>"maximumProcessingDurationMillis value"</b>. If it’s like that, the app’s value adjustment is evident in terms of the <em>WebViewer1.WebViewString property</em>.</p>

<p style="font-family:verdana">This is done by the conjoining of the adds, the text “timeout” to the current value of <em>StringToBeProcessedByJavascriptFile.Text</em> to make it different from the value of the <em>StringToBeProcessedByJavascriptFile.Text</em>. Users must ensure that the next time the <em>Clock1.Timer</em> event is triggered; the first check will not succeed. As soon as the first check fails, the app will start again that will lead to the <em>StringToBeProcessedByJavascriptFile.Text</em> to an empty string. The setting of the <em>Clock1.TimerEnabled</em> to “false”, and then by displaying a message to the user in a Message Dialog section that includes the outcome of the processing of the javascript, and the time of how long the process was. The output of the processing is accessible to the app, located in the <em>WebViewer1.WebViewString</em> property that’s set inside the javascript processing file.</p> 

<p style="font-family:verdana">Lastly, the <b>"currentProcessingDurationMillis"</b> is reset to 0, so the next time the user clicks on the <em>btnProcess</em>, the app will calculate the processing duration accurately, as a final clean-up measure.</p>

<h3 style="font-family:verdana">List the skills are required for your project, including software that needs to be written, and special hardware (if any). How feasible will it be to find the skills, software and hardware required?</h3>

<p style="font-family:verdana">The skills that are required for this project includes the basics of making your projects from MIT project app that include the use of the “designer” editor component that determines the search of your components of your choice and to select certain properties of each component such as size, colour and behaviour. Lastly, the use of the “blocks” editor component for this project is used for the preferred behaviours for particular components. You can do this by looking for Blocks for the general behaviours you want to apply to your project by dragging them to the Blocks Viewer. Lastly, the skills, software and the hardware required are achievable through YouTube tutorials for tips and steps on how to create your first project or game, even if you’re just learning. Also, searching for the particular language, software and hardware used are achievable to find through the actual MIT app inventor website which will tell you the details regarding about the specific software and even versions and browsers that are applicable to use this inventor app for your projects.</p>

<h3 style="font-family:verdana">If the project is successful, what will be the outcome? How will the original problem be solved? What impact will this development have?</h3>

<p style="font-family:verdana">If this project was successful, the outcome will be a good starting point due to the usefulness of this app that will lead to enticing new users playing this game. With a combination of low levels of difficulty in terms of how to play the game and the skills needed and the simplicity of the game in terms of visuals, effects, and movements will lead this game to further success. Fixing minor problems in the software and adjusting the sizes and behaviour of each component if changes are being implemented can lead to upgrading your project slowly via designer and blocks editor sections. Also, the impact of this development will be a good comparison with other simple apps that are just getting started from small markets and hopefully it can grow one day due to how easy the game is being played and the way it draws you in after a long exhausting day. Lastly, the reviews are available and offered from either the App Store or Google Play Store for the benefit of the marketing aspect of this game that will lead to attracting more and new potential consumers. Also, it’s implemented if there will be further improvements that will need to be made that include bug fixes, interfaces, required updates and many more. Most of the time, the negative feedbacks or critiques are the ones that will redirect your success if developers take the critiques seriously.</p>   

<h3 style="font-family:verdana">Feedback</h3>

<h3 style="font-family:verdana">Suggestions/Developments</h3>

<h3 style="font-family:verdana">Identification of the niche/markets/needs</h3>

<p style="font-family:verdana">The niche of this project idea includes gamers.  Also, the recommended gamers are the ones that are still inexperienced, and the ones who are starting to become gamers. Because of this, this will lead to meeting their criteria and needs due to the overall simplicity and low levels of complexity within the duration of the game.</p>

<p style="font-family:verdana">Its market niche is gaming and gadgets/technology since:</p>

<p style="font-family:verdana"> - One of the plans that are being implemented includes marketing the game from MIT App Inventor by selling it via App Store for Apple consumers and Google Play Store for Android consumers.</p>

<p style="font-family:verdana"> -	When the game will be sold to Apple and Android consumers through their respective smartphone stores, there are expectations to compete with categories that include kids (even if this game is aimed for all ages, this can be for kids too, and it will be enjoyable), and entertainment (due to the game being focused as a stress reliever during the consumer’s long days of either work, study, gym, going out with friends and many more).</p>

<p style="font-family:verdana"> -	Consumers want the latest version of apps in their smartphones, and we got them covered, as the game is made via the latest version of MIT App Inventor.</p>
  
<p style="font-family:verdana">Also, this game will be aimed for specific customer product needs that include experience, functionality, reliability, efficiency, performance, price and compatibility. The reasons are as follows:</p>

<p style="font-family:verdana"> -	For experience, consumers don’t need to obtain a lot of experience to play the game that is why it’s aimed for all ages because of its overall simplicity and low levels of complexity or easy in other words. This will result in not making consumers feel irritated to achieve such levels, and to not create more work for them, compared to other games (e.g. League of Legends, “LOL” for short, consumers like gamers must obtain certain skills and abilities for the benefit of their levels, rankings in ranked games, character enhancements, and overall user reputation).</p>

<p style="font-family:verdana"> -	In terms of functionality, reliability and efficiency, MIT App Inventor is a secure web development and application site that will ensure consumers that the product that they are using are functioning, reliable and efficient, in terms of what it needs to do for the overall satisfaction from the consumers.</p>
  
<p style="font-family:verdana"> -	For overall performance, consumers wouldn’t need to worry as the application of the “blocks” editor component are implemented for the preferred behaviours for particular components that will lead to the components being run properly.</p> 

<p style="font-family:verdana"> -	For price, consumers shouldn’t even think about spending a dime for this app to download to their smartphones because it’s free to download.</p> 

<p style="font-family:verdana"> - Lastly, in terms of compatibility, consumers shouldn’t worry at all even if they are using Apple or Android smartphones. However, Android is mostly recommended.</p>

<p style="font-family:verdana">Also, this game will be aimed for specific customer service needs that include transparency, empathy, information, and accessibility. The reason are as follows:</p>
