<h4>A description of the position and particularly what makes the position appealing to you.</h4>

<p>The position is a system admin, IT support offered by FourQuarters Recruitment. This job suits me as it tackles the networking aspect of IT (IT Networking and Database Administration). This position is appealing due to the skills that I’ll learn throughout the whole duration of this course that I’m currently taking such as developing technical skills in terms of operating systems that include desktop and server, creating an excellent operating environment, the development of appropriate technical documentation, and the experience in terms of administrating the service desk and IT support ticketing systems.</p>

<h4>A description of the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position.</h4>

<p>The skills and experiences that will be required for this position include general networking skills that include monitoring an entire network in a workplace, establishing the network security and the administration of various network standards for users such as permissions and access levels. Lastly, the qualifications needed for this position include a degree in Bachelor of Information Technology, Major Networking & Security, or a degree in Bachelor of Information Technology (Honours).</p>

<h4>A description of the skills, qualifications and experience you currently have.</h4>

<p>Currently, the skills and experiences that I’ll gain are from a unit called Introduction to Information Technology (COSC2196). Lastly, I don’t have any current qualifications related to IT.</p>

<h4>A plan describing how you will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position. This doesn’t need to be greatly detailed.</h4>

<p>In order to obtain such skills, you must have the basic skills expected from IT’s include communication, creativity, perseverance, analytical abilities, project management, problem solving and resourcefulness. Also, the most important one that will mostly land you this job includes technical skills that will vary job to job such as training; hands-on experiences like volunteering or doing side work form your computer. It’s easier to learn some of these skills than some soft skills that are mentioned above, which you learned from studying IT because they’re often intuitive to individuals who are suitable for careers in IT. Also, the recommended qualification needed for a successful employment is finishing a degree in Bachelor of Information Technology, Major Networking & Security, and the other alternative is Bachelor of Information Technology (Honours). Lastly, the experiences needed or this job include IT Networking and Database Administration, the development of technical skills in terms of operating systems that include desktop and server, creating an excellent overall operating environment, and the development of appropriate technical documentation knowledge in Systems protocols that include TCP/IP, DNS, DHCP, Group Policy, VOIP, Active Directory and routing protocols.</p>

<h4>Compare and contrast the ideal jobs for each person in the group.</h4>

<p>My job consists of tackling the networking aspect of IT that includes creating an excellent operating environment, operating systems such as server and desktop, developing appropriate technical documentation and the experience in carrying out the service desk and IT support ticketing systems, as expected from a system admin in IT support. For Edward, his job consists of helping other individuals in terms of experience and developing a social culture that will result in a successful working environment. Also, it consists of financial marketing and actuarial experience.</p>

<h4>What common elements are there, if any?</h4>

<h4>What differentiates each position from the others, if anything?</h4>

<p>In my opinion, the noticeable differences between my position and Edward’s position are the roles and the aspects of the jobs that we focus on for the improvement of the working environment and overall success.  I’m a system admin in IT support, which mainly focuses on the networking aspect of IT such as developing technical skills in terms of operating systems that include desktop and server, creating an excellent overall operating environment, and the development of appropriate technical documentation knowledge in Systems protocols that include TCP/IP, DNS, DHCP, Group Policy, VOIP, Active Directory and routing protocols. Lastly, Edward’s position is an investment adviser in Equities and Derivatives, which mainly focuses on financial markets, which includes a familiarity with topics that are correlated to Australian equity markets, and progress in qualifications that include the CFP/CFA/Master of Finance.</p> 

<h4>How similar or different are your career plans across the group?</h4>

<p>In terms of similarity, there are some similarities for me and Edward’s career plans due to the degree of difficulty of our career paths that we chose for ourselves. For being a system administrator, it requires a particular person, dedication, experience, and integrity. Sometimes, being a system admin will take you around the years of working up the ladder to become a good system admin. For being an investment adviser, it’s included as one of the highest stress rates in the industry. Starting this career can go through a great deal of stress, as this career is deeply associated with the performance of global and domestic markets. Lastly, investment advisers are managing the client’s emotions constantly during the downturns in the market that can result to a high level of stress over time.</p>

<p>Also, in terms of differences, there are some noticeable ones from our career paths chosen that include a completely different field, study, and requirements that will be needed for a potential employment. For example, for being a system admin in IT support, completing the course of Bachelor of Information Technology, Major in Networking & Security is needed, or a degree in Bachelor of Information Technology (Honours) as an alternative whereas being an investment advisor, completing the RG146 Training Course via an undergraduate degree in Financial Planning, and series of examinations that is split in three parts of your study is needed to be a qualified Actuary by being recognised by the Institute of Actuarial Studies.</p>
