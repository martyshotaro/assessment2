<h4>Group Meeting 1:</h4>

<p>What we have done so far in this assignment is that we finally had our first meeting on the 9th of October, which is also in a Friday. We mainly tackled the issues regarding about our project idea. In this case, a “Temperature Scanner”, which consists of searching for individuals who are affected at any point in time in any large areas that include public transport, ferry, airport, malls, buildings, and etc. Future details regarding about this project will be discussed in the next meetings. Lastly, we tackled about the confusing parts of our assignment, and the components that we need to get done as soon as possible.</p>
