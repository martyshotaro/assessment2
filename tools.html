<h4 style="font-family:verdana">Group Meeting 1:</h4>

<p style="font-family:verdana">What we have done so far in this assignment is that we finally had our first meeting on the 9th of October, which is also in a Friday. We mainly tackled the issues regarding about our project idea. In this case, a “Temperature Scanner”, which consists of searching for individuals who are affected at any point in time in any large areas that include public transport, ferry, airport, malls, buildings, and etc. Future details regarding about this project will be discussed in the next meetings. Lastly, we tackled about the confusing parts of our assignment, and the components that we need to get done as soon as possible.</p> 

<h4 style="font-family:verdana">Group Meeting 2:</h4>

<p style="font-family:verdana">What we will discuss is about changes regarding about out project idea. We came up with the idea of a “Temperature Scanner”, but I had a change of mind as soon as I got my marks for A1. The marker told me that he enjoyed my game and it’s an overall an excellent game that I made as my project idea in A1 that led me to stick with this and hopefully my group members can come up with better improvements, details (e.g. a better expansion in terms of skills and tools usage that is based on the backhand that classifies the technologies behind the MIT App Inventor), and our future plans and implementations that we will deliver in A3 next month. Also, we discussed about the last parts of our assignment for the finishing touch. Lastly, we discussed about the “IT Work” component of A2 regarding about how to improve in terms of asking questions in an interview. For my other group member’s case, he is just using an audio for interviewing an IT professional. The tips that I gave him beforehand include tonality, confidence, professionalism in asking questions and many more.</p>
