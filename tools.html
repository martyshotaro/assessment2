<h4 style="font-family:verdana">Group Meeting 1:</h4>

<p style="font-family:verdana">What we have done so far in this assignment is that we finally had our first meeting on the 9th of October, which is also in a Friday. We mainly tackled the issues regarding about our project idea. In this case, a “Temperature Scanner”, which consists of searching for individuals who are affected at any point in time in any large areas that include public transport, ferry, airport, malls, buildings, and etc. Future details regarding about this project will be discussed in the next meetings. Lastly, we tackled about the confusing parts of our assignment, and the components that we need to get done as soon as possible.</p> 

<h4 style="font-family:verdana">Group Meeting 2:</h4>

<p style="font-family:verdana">What we tackled about is the confusing aspects of Industry Data. We also discussed the components of A2 towards its near completion. Also, the changes regarding about out project idea was already implemented. We came up with the idea of a “Temperature Scanner”, but I had a change of mind as soon as I got my marks for A1 (my project idea in A1 is a “Mini Fling It In!”, which consists of flicking the ball to a particular area with obstacles that include 2D rectangle lines and they’re immobile throughout the duration of the game in order to get the ball through to succeed and win the game). The marker told me that he enjoyed my game and it’s an overall an excellent game that I made as my project idea in A1 that led me to stick with this and hopefully my group members can come up with better improvements, details (e.g. a better expansion in terms of skills and tools usage that is based on the backhand that classifies the technologies behind the MIT App Inventor), and our future plans and implementations that we will deliver in A3 next month. Also, Edward is in charge of the feedback, development, and suggestions of this project idea in A2 and its due before our next meeting. Also we concluded out meeting with mentioning the components that needs to be finished for the benefit of our overall completion in A2.</p>

<h3 style="font-family:verdana">Comments on how well the audit trail or log of activity on the Git repository reflects your group’s work.</h3>

<p style="font-family:verdana">Smart: As an individual who owns a repository in this assessment, my GitHub log activity reflects my group's work in this assignment in a positive way due to the time, effort, and knowledge that were put into this assignment.</p>

<p style="font-family:verdana">Edward:The GitHub repository was a difficult task in this particular case. Unfortunately, due to unforeseen circumstances, we were unable to pull the request and did not have an audit trail for all group members. Our work was split between two individuals, which required elevated effort elsewhere.</p>
