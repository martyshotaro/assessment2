<h2>Group Reflection:</h2>

<h4>What went well?</h4>  
  
<p>Smart: The things that went well were I had an early good start on attempting this assignment by answering questions, doing research for related contexts/images to back up the questions, building a GitHub repository straight away and my website/template via HTML and GitHub Pages.</p>

<p>Edward:</p>

<h4>What could be improved?</h4>

<p>Smart: There’s one component that needs improvement, which is a consistent communication with my group member (Edward) via MS Teams and Discord. Also, since we are mostly busy due to personal commitments, it’s a little bit hard to set up a schedule for meetings to discuss on how to complete this assessment and if we need help, we ask each other questions. However, we managed to get through at times. </p>
