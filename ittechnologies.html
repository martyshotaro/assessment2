<h3>Clouds, services, servers</h3>

<h4>What is the state of the art of this new technology? What can be done now? What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)? What technological or other developments make this possible?</h4> 

<p>Cloud is referred as a metaphor for “the Internet”, which means a type of computing that is Internet-based computing where different services such as applications, storage, and servers are delivered to a particular organisation’s devices and computers via the Internet. Examples of cloud include Microsoft 365, Salesforce, and Adobe Creative Cloud. Cloud helps in distributing resources, which is often labelled as  “federated storage clouds” that leads to being tolerant with faults because of data distribution. Through the use of cloud, it lessens the creation of the files’ different versions because of the shared access to files, documents and data.</p>  

<p>For services regarding about cloud computing, there are three main categories, which are IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS.</p>

<p>IaaS stands for “infrastructure as a service”, which refers to the infrastructure resources that are cloud-based that is delivered to organisations through the use of virtualization technology that aids the organisations to manage and build their servers, operating systems, data storage and network. Examples of IaaS include Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS). Also, IaaS helps companies in regards to managing and building their own data as they expand, paying for server and storage space for the foundation of the software and hardware with no hosting and managing servers by themselves on-site. Lastly, the IaaS’ products make up for the structure of building new technologies via cloud.</p>  

<p>PaaS stands for “platform as a service”, which refers to the cloud-based platform services that gives the developers a scheme that they can apply to make custom applications. Examples of PaaS include OpenShift and Google App Engine. Lastly, PaaS helps developers construct custom applications online without dealing with storage, data services, and management.</p>

<p>SaaS stands for “software as a service”, which refers to a software that is cloud-based, which is hosted online by a company and it’s available for acquirement on a subscription basis and delivered through the use of internet. Examples of SaaS include Dropbox and JIRA. Also, SaaS helps distributed global teams of individuals who don’t work in terms of close physical concurrence. Also, it helps businesses to manage and use SaaS, which is also highly adaptable and wouldn’t be required to be downloaded and installed via devices to arrange it to a company or a team.</p>

<p>Cloud severs refers to a server that runs in a cloud computing environment. It’s hosted, built, and delivered through the use of cloud computing platform from the internet, which can be accessible remotely. Examples of cloud servers include Amazon elastic Compute Cloud, Google Compute Engine, Azure, HP and Microsoft Gold partnerships and Dell Premier Partner. Cloud servers help in running and functioning as independent units. Also, they help in giving users the security and stability due to the software problems are isolated from your environment. They also avoid hardware issues, which are seen with physical servers that result in being likely to be the most stable option for a business in terms of saving IT costs. Lastly, they offer scalability, which makes it quick and easier to upgrade by adding the memory and disk space.</p>

Machine learning implements the unsupervised algorithms for the identification of particular results. Through the use of its instrumentality, machine learning makes predictions from the datasets when the only available thing is the input data, without any corresponding output variables. On the other hand, supervised algorithms work differently. The output of an algorithm that’s given is already known in supervised learning. The algorithms that are unsupervised work on AI. When the algorithms are left alone to work on its own, they discover and identify the interesting hidden patterns or groupings within a dataset which would have not been identified by using supervised algorithms. In the next upcoming years during the evolution of this, individuals will witness more improvements in unsupervised machine learning algorithms.</p>
  
<p>Through the use of algorithms from machine learning to render augmented personalisation is an important machine learning application. They are applied to offer product recommendations to customers. Also, companies use machine learning techniques to identify an individual’s browsing activity. Using this information that was gathered, companies send product recommendations that include personalised emails and messages to their target audience. Also, machine learning techniques help in understanding consumers’ needs, wants, likes, and dislikes that keep an eye to your products and services. Because of this, it’s reported that 82% of the marketing leaders are adopting AI and machine learning for further improvement of their overall aspect. By enticing your customers to their desire, you can increase customer retention through the use of machine learning techniques is the future.</p>

<p>In terms of marketing and sales, machine learning is a big help in remodelling the marketing sector that led to the companies applying artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning for the expansion of customer satisfaction by over 10% successfully. Forbes states that 57% of enterprise executives give credence to the most crucial growth benefit of machine learning and AI, which is the betterment of customer support and experiences. Social media platforms and sites that include Facebook and Twitter and E-commerce are showing support by using machine learning in order to analyse the search and purchase history and making recommendations on other items to purchase that is entirely based on your past preferences and habits. Theories have speculated by experts that the future of retail is machine learning and AI driven, as deep learning businesses applications become more consummate in terms of skills that include analysing, capturing, and using data in order to personalise the individuals’ shopping experiences, so that the customised targeted marketing campaigns can be developed and implemented.</p> 
  
<p>Transportation is also one of the factors/sectors that were helped by machine learning in terms of accuracy and efficiency, and the capability to alleviate the potential problems, which results in profitability. Also, the data analysis and modelling functions of machine learning coincide perfectly with businesses within the public transportation, delivery, and freight transport sectors. Lastly, machine learning uses algorithms to search for factors that influence a supply chain’s success, either positively and negatively that makes machine learning a crucial component within the supply chain management.</p>  
  
<p>Machine learning has also help manufacturers and companies in terms of improvement on logistic solutions such as supply chain, assets, and inventory management. Also, machine learning plays a crucial role as one of the keys in amplifying the overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) through the use of measurement of the performance, availability and the quality of assembly equipment. Lastly, machine learning are about achieving the goal of improving the operations from a brain wave towards the final delivery, significantly reducing error rates, improving predictive maintenance, and increasing inventory turn.</p>
  
<p>Through the implementation of wearable sensors and devices that can monitor pulse rates and steps walked to oxygen and, sleeping patterns, sugar levels have generated an eloquent volume of data, which gives doctors the ability to assess the health of their patients. This is all because of machine learning that gave benefits to overall healthcare for all individuals. Another interesting fact is that machine learning’s algorithm can analyse cancerous tumours on mammograms, retinal images for the identification of diabetic retinopathy and even skin cancer.</p>   
   
<h4>In your daily life, how will this affect you? What will be different for you? How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</h4> 
  
<p>In our daily lives, machine learning can affect and revolutionise me, my family and friends through the enhanced versions of health, education, law, and transportation.</p>
  
<p>For the health component, machine learning is implemented for swift patient diagnosis and the accelerated healthcare delivery.

Also, machine learning can empower surgical robots, as instruments in order to help the doctors in medical procedures, whilst ensuring minimal invasion and high precision simultaneously. Through this, it is noticeable that the improvement of success rates of surgical procedures and accelerate turnaround time with cost benefits are present. Lastly, machine learning can be a crucial to detect efficient diagnosis, treatment and research, in case if I, my friends or family fell ill unexpectedly.</p>  
  
<p>Machine learning can help assess a student’s understanding academically; it can also identify the way student gains knowledge. Because of this, it will lead to creating a customised academic plan that can help focus on the student’s particular attributes. The algorithms analyse test results and it also create a grading system that is unique, in which can free up the teachers’ time to mark exam papers and help refine the education modules for students. A bonus feature of machine learning is that it can be handy for students who are suffering with disabilities and learning gaps such as dyslexia. Lastly, machine learning can simplify administrative duties and help schools implement an organised means of administering students and staff by automated customised software and responses.</p>
  
<p>In terms of law, machine learning is capable of developing documents, the analysation and the processing of proofs and research that results in lawyers extracting related information without having to send more time in pouring over books and legal documents. Also, machine learning can aid in systemising operational tasks that includes staying alongside with the hearings and keeping note of the impending dates. Lastly, machine learning can strategize on how will the lawyers review and speed up cases.</p>  
  
<p>Machine learning applied the deployment of sensory management and automation, which resulted in the vehicles processing the surrounding parameter, then taking the precautionary action whenever required to ensure passenger safety as a next step. It’s reported that China is testing driverless buses for its city, whereas Rolls Royce and Google have agreed to collaborate, for the implementation of the design and to launch the world’s first self-driving ship by this year in 2020. The ship will be leveraging Google’s Cloud Machine Learning Engine to investigate its surroundings. It leads to capacitating the remote control of the vessel and reducing the resources associated inside the transportation. Beyond vehicles, machine learning can be deployed for traffic management and prevention of traffic congestions soon.</p>   

<h3>Autonomous Vehicles</h3>  
  
<h4>What is the state of the art of this new technology? What can be done now? What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)? What technological or other developments make this possible?</h4>
  
<p>Self-driving cars are invented to reform the transportation industry. There are many noticeable shifts in the auto industry ever since the beginning of commercial auto production, which is around eight decades ago. Newly manufactured cars already have automated features that include collision and parking detection. ADS (Automated Driving Systems) for trucks, vans, and cars are on its way to go through opportunities and adjustments. This includes features like machine-corrective and machine-assisted technologies like lane correction, automated parking, and potential collision detection.</p> 
  
<p>The examples of manufacturers that applied this are Audi and Tesla. Some manufacturers like Ford, Volvo and Baidu are already teaming up and planning to launch Level 4 autonomous vehicles next year in 2021. A Level 4 autonomous vehicle consists of carrying out all the driving functions and it doesn’t need a driver to take over in the navigation. Nonetheless, the ADS navigation’s quality can regress under particular conditions that include off-road driving or other types of hazardous situations that may lead to a human driver having the ability to control the moving vehicle. Also, Elon Musk, the founder and the CEO of Tesla have mentioned that Level 5 vehicles are ready to be launched this year in 2020. A Level 5 autonomous vehicle consists of features that include an advanced ADS system that is capable of carrying out all driving functions despite harsh conditions. However, human intervention may be compulsory to control the vehicle at times.</p> 
  
<p>However, other industry figures and analysts have a more cautious outlook on the technology's development. This includes Steve Wozniak; the co-founder of Apple was once buoyant on the future of self-driving cars, believing that this technology is very far away from being competent.</p>
  
<p>The ADS technology came long way, but enhancements still needs further improvement in order for Level 4 and 5 driverless cars can be sold to consumers. Lastly, the varying range of projections on when these technology advancements will arrive at the consumer level suggests that manufacturers and companies should be using different grading systems for the evaluation of the driverless cars’ overall functionality.</p>  
    
<h4>What is the potential impact of this development? What is likely to change? Which people will be most affected and how? Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</h4>
  
<p>The potential impact of autonomous vehicles consists of economic shifts, industrial changes, changes in car insurance and driving safety, and saving time for the commuters. Research projects that the adoption of autonomous vehicles in terms of consumer life and business will have a definite impact/change on the economy.</p>
  
<p>A study by BCG, a research group predicts that in 2035, 12 million autonomous vehicles and 18 million partially autonomous vehicles will be sold globally each year. Also, autonomous vehicles will hold 25% of the new car market, with market growth somewhere between the $42 billion and $77 billion range. Public transit drivers or taxis are jobs that are currently applied with human intervention can potentially be the outcome of autonomous vehicles operation on their own. Also, manufacturing, construction workers, and farmers could be replaced by autonomous vehicles conceivably, which are projected to do repetitive and specific tasks in those fields.</p>
  
<p>The farming and mining industries have already adopted autonomous vehicles due to the technology becoming more affordable for them. The use of such vehicles by mining companies aids its worker safety in terms of high-risk environment through the use of taking operators out of their sections when they can be trapped in collapsing tunnels or caves. Also, the use of autonomous vehicles can save on labour costs; reduce carbon dioxide emissions as much as 60% from optimised driving. For construction, the use of loaders, forklifts and excavators can also save on labour costs and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.</p> 
  
<p>Nowadays, consumers will be influenced in terms of how insurance companies manage and conduct their business, as insurance companies might reconsider the traditional business models. Experts have considered a way to ensuring car manufacturers against liability that leads from technical failures, that is linked with autonomous vehicles. Mercedes, Volvo, and Google are the companies that have started self-insuring the products they create.</p>  
  
<p>A goal that was set for driverless cars is to imply a significant health and safety benefit, and they’re expected to reduce the accidents and casualties in the road. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration stated that around 35,092 individuals were killed in 2015 in automobile accidents on U.S. roads and car crashes have a considerable impact on the U.S. economy, leading to costing around $871 billion annually. Also, a recent study from McKinsey & Company, autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assistance systems have the potential to take away the motor vehicle deaths by 90%, that saves thousands of individual’s lives and roughly $190 billion annually in terms of health care figures.</p>
  
<p>Autonomous vehicles are predicted to save time for the commuters by increasing the flow of the traffic that can lead to the travel times being reduced. Based on the U.S. Census Bureau, Americans spent a total of 29.6 billion hours commuting back in 2014, but with the help of driverless vehicles, a portion of this commute time can be used for reading, accessing, working, relaxing, entertainment and having a better life. However, there are decisions and challenges that arise before autonomous vehicles can take over that include the impact of consumers and businesses, the increased safety for the passengers and drivers, the reduced health care and the labour costs for businesses.</p>  
  
<h4>In your daily life, how will this affect you? What will be different for you? How might these affect members of your family or your friends?</h4>  
  
<p>In our daily lives, autonomous vehicles can affect me, my family and friends through living arrangements, road accidents, and cities.</p> 
  
<p>Based on a report on trends in U.S. real estate in 2017, MIT researchers predicted that individuals will be influenced in terms of their preferred living arrangements by autonomous cars through the choice of independent living. However, individuals who are disabled, sick, or even the elderly might face challenges because of a major change they will face is moving along because of autonomous cars. Currently, a company called “Alphabet” are testing design tools that include buttons with braille (which is a touch system that consists of reading and writing for individuals who are blind, in which raised dots represent the letters of the alphabet), in order to ensure that the impaired individuals move around with their driverless cars.</p>
  
<p>Also, one of the mail focal points behind the production of autonomous cars is to reduce possible accidents and casualties on the road. The production of such autonomous cars is backed up through the use of sense for the detection of crossing pedestrians, signage, and traffic lanes. Also, autonomous cars will result in less pressure when drunk driving and fatigue, which leads to being relaxed and individuals can sleep at the backseat while their cars transport them back home, and will also results in a regression of needing a DUI attorney.</p>
  
<p>Autonomous cars will have a major effect in terms of how cities are going to be built, the laws and taxes. When traffic occurs, the braking and acceleration will be reduced, which translates to fewer gridlocks. Also, cities may have to change the way their traffic lights operate. Cities will also notice adjustments in road constructions as more emphasis will be placed on pedestrians since autonomous cars move with higher precision than cars that require human intervention. Roads will equally be narrower, thereby creating more space for pedestrians and cyclists to move freely. Due to the precision of autonomous vehicles, the need for investing highly in speed cameras wouldn’t be a concern. In fact, they will always park correctly and adhere to the speed limits. Lastly, there will be a reduction in the revenue generated from the traffic fines.</p>
