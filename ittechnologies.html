<h2 style="font-family:verdana">IT Technologies</h2>

<h3 style="font-family:verdana">Clouds, services, servers</h3>

<h4 style="font-family:verdana">What is the state of the art of this new technology? What can be done now? What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)? What technological or other developments make this possible?</h4> 

<p style="font-family:verdana">Cloud is referred as a metaphor for “the Internet”, which means a type of computing that is Internet-based computing where different services such as applications, storage, and servers are delivered to a particular organisation’s devices and computers via the Internet. Examples of cloud include Microsoft 365, Salesforce, and Adobe Creative Cloud. Cloud helps in distributing resources, which is often labelled as  “federated storage clouds” that leads to being tolerant with faults because of data distribution. Through the use of cloud, it lessens the creation of the files’ different versions because of the shared access to files, documents and data.</p>  

<p style="font-family:verdana">For services regarding about cloud computing, there are three main categories, which are IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS.</p>

<p style="font-family:verdana">IaaS stands for “infrastructure as a service”, which refers to the infrastructure resources that are cloud-based that is delivered to organisations through the use of virtualization technology that aids the organisations to manage and build their servers, operating systems, data storage and network. Examples of IaaS include Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS). Also, IaaS helps companies in regards to managing and building their own data as they expand, paying for server and storage space for the foundation of the software and hardware with no hosting and managing servers by themselves on-site. Lastly, the IaaS’ products make up for the structure of building new technologies via cloud.</p>  

<p style="font-family:verdana">PaaS stands for “platform as a service”, which refers to the cloud-based platform services that gives the developers a scheme that they can apply to make custom applications. Examples of PaaS include OpenShift and Google App Engine. Lastly, PaaS helps developers construct custom applications online without dealing with storage, data services, and management.</p>

<p style="font-family:verdana">SaaS stands for “software as a service”, which refers to a software that is cloud-based, which is hosted online by a company and it’s available for acquirement on a subscription basis and delivered through the use of internet. Examples of SaaS include Dropbox and JIRA. Also, SaaS helps distributed global teams of individuals who don’t work in terms of close physical concurrence. Also, it helps businesses to manage and use SaaS, which is also highly adaptable and wouldn’t be required to be downloaded and installed via devices to arrange it to a company or a team.</p>

<p style="font-family:verdana">Cloud severs refers to a server that runs in a cloud computing environment. It’s hosted, built, and delivered through the use of cloud computing platform from the internet, which can be accessible remotely. Examples of cloud servers include Amazon elastic Compute Cloud, Google Compute Engine, Azure, HP and Microsoft Gold partnerships and Dell Premier Partner. Cloud servers help in running and functioning as independent units. Also, they help in giving users the security and stability due to the software problems are isolated from your environment. They also avoid hardware issues, which are seen with physical servers that result in being likely to be the most stable option for a business in terms of saving IT costs. Lastly, they offer scalability, which makes it quick and easier to upgrade by adding the memory and disk space.</p> 

<h4 style="font-family:verdana">What is the potential impact of this development? What is likely to change? Which people will be most affected and how? Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</h4>

<p style="font-family:verdana">The potential impact of clouds, services, and servers, or cloud computing include cost reduction, bigger storage, better mobility and flexibility, security, and more accessible upgrades.</p>

<p style="font-family:verdana">A company’s expenses are reduced by cloud computing, as the resources are only needed when it’s necessary, and only paid for the billing model, which works per one usage. Not spending it on infrastructure will lessen its initial expenses and overall maintenance cost. Lastly, the clients are not the owners of the infrastructure but have the access for the online cloud services.</p>

<p style="font-family:verdana">Some cloud providers offer the storage as service to its customers. Because of this, companies can store more data on cloud than expected via local devices. During the growth process of a business, it will demand for more storage, and they will scale up and get more storage from the cloud provider conveniently.</p>

<p style="font-family:verdana">Cloud users can gain access through its services at any time, or anywhere from a discrepancy of devices. Whenever they have access the internet, they can login and use the services. Lastly, this result in benefiting the cloud computing that provides flexible work culture to the employees so that they can perform their duties from anywhere or anytime with no physical ways needed.</p> 

<p style="font-family:verdana">In terms of flexibility, cloud computing is a beneficiary to its customers, as they are free to decide which services they need and pay for correspondingly. The cloud services are evident to meet expectations through the adjustments of business demands by providing several services. Lastly, if there are any application that’s provided by the cloud is not doing a good job, we have the capability and the flexibility to switch to another cloud.</p>

<p style="font-family:verdana">Security is one of the most crucial components of cloud computing choices that are made by customers. It’s important because of the cloud provider gives privacy and security to the data and storage. Lastly, it’s one of the main reasons that providers invest a large sum of expenses on their infrastructure and services for better security purposes that are offered by the cloud.</p> 

<p style="font-family:verdana">The cloud providers are responsible in terms of upgrading the infrastructure and services for customers. Also, new business solutions and trends are now accessible to the customers, provided by the cloud providers for the competition in the business market through the latest technologies’ adaptation. Lastly, the cloud providers maintain the system by doing different software and security updates.</p>  

<h4 style="font-family:verdana">In your daily life, how will this affect you? What will be different for you? How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</h4>

<p style="font-family:verdana">Cloud computing affects me in many ways, in terms of social impact, health, and better interactions with applications and the internet (in this case, it’s Google mail services).</p> 

<p style="font-family:verdana">For social impact, if affects my daily life through the likes of YouTube and Google, which are a testimony in how individuals are interacting with others nowadays via remote locations to global centre stage. Anyone can turn into an instant reporter and news feeds that are live are being constantly streamed by the media. Even politicians and public figures are turning into engines like Twitter getting a feel of the community and by conveying their perspectives while bearing the influence and the pressure at the same time from the groups or communities that they are looking after.</p>

<p style="font-family:verdana">In terms of health, it affects me by when either any of my family members, friends, or even myself got sick, the cloud technology in the healthcare industry is expanding its pace via the management of non-soiled patient data and can be shared among medical professionals or patients in different parties and their own status and follow-up treatments or even daily check-ups can be checked that can result in the operational costs such as data storage can be reduced. Lastly, it will be different, as there are possibilities that challenges may arise in terms of old and current tools with newer technologies and service levels, the benefits will compensate the inhibition to transfer to the cloud.</p>   
  
<p style="font-family:verdana">The implementation of Google mail services is an example of better interactions in terms of applications and the internet. In this cloud computing formulation, Google will do its job to host the mail services for you, instead of spending too much time on burdening your computer, laptop or any device with software to organise your mails. Also Google gives customers the capability to do it online by just connecting your device to the internet.</p>   
  
<h3 style="font-family:verdana">Cybersecurity</h3>

<h4 style="font-family:verdana">What is the state of the art of this new technology? What can be done now? What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)? What technological or other developments make this possible?</h4>

<p style="font-family:verdana">Cybersecurity is the description of the internet-connected systems’ protection that includes software, hardware and data from cyber threats. Its future is hard to predict due to the industry is evolving quickly, in response to the shifting behaviours and attacks of cybercriminals they scheme.</p>

<p style="font-family:verdana">Nowadays, AI and the machine learning algorithms can be implemented for tasks that need to be automated, decision making that is way ahead that a human could do, and crunch data. Nonetheless, technologies that are new like AI, have created cybersecurity risks as potential exploits that are poorly understood at the time of its release intrinsically, which results in more organizations are relying on machine learning in terms of mission-critical operations. AI systems are ensured to become a major target for hackers. In response, future cybersecurity software and personnel will be forced to develop techniques to counterattack the AI corruption attempts. Cybersecurity developers will themselves use AI to search for security issues and vulnerabilities before they can be taken advantage of because AI won’t just make adjustments to the cybersecurity world by giving hackers tips to get to target organisations. Developers in the following years to come may impact AI in user interfaces to warn individuals regarding about the risky websites or poor-quality security choices as an example. Lastly, AI may also be used to create simulated network attacks that lead to exploiting weak links.</p> 

<p style="font-family:verdana">Michel Cukier, a University of Maryland researcher carried out a study that the computer hacks are becoming more recurring that it got to the point that the average time of computer hacks are every 39 seconds. Cyberattacks are done through the use of automated scripts that go through digital addresses and databases, which explore vulnerabilities to exploit most of the time. Individuals who are an IT specialist must be the reason to have written attack scripts, and there’s good reason to believe that the amount of individuals with the skills and motivation to run them will grow in the future. In the developing countries that include Afghanistan or South Africa, the improvement of educational standards are evident that results in producing a massive expansion of the tech workforce. However, in many areas of these developing countries mentioned or any developing country, there aren’t jobs for these trained workers that cause them to turn to cybercrime instead.</p>

<p style="font-family:verdana">Companies are spending extra time than ever on protecting themselves when the cyberattacks are rapidly increasing every year. There’s a suggestion from current projections that the global cybersecurity market is going to be worth around $42 billion alone in this year in 2020. Nonetheless, there’s only so much that the funded software can do to protect businesses. A stumbling block is when there’s a large amount of worker shortage that are skills at this present time. Global Information Study Workforce states that around the year 2022, the gap between available positions and the qualified personnel will expand thoroughly to an estimate of two million occupations. Well advised organisations will heavily invest in InfoSec training for their current employees. Because of this, it will cost too much and hard for the companies to hire experts that are in the cybersecurity field, in which they require hopelessly.</p> 

<p style="font-family:verdana">The legacy systems have presented a major cybersecurity risk during the occurrence of the WannaCry ransomware attack back in the year 2017, in which resulted in over 200,000 computers that run the Windows older versions in 150n countries being infected by malware. Because of the events that happened, there’s little motivation for companies and manufacturers releasing security patches for obsolete or outdated systems. Companies worldwide are continuing to expose themselves to cyber risk by the use of continuing to use vulnerable legacy technology despite the issues. This is being implemented for saving costs or maybe because when upgrading, businesses don’t identify the security benefits being given to them. In the future, it will continue to worsen, as countless companies and consumers are perfectly satisfied with the performance of their smartphones, desktops, and servers in today’s modern generation. Also, a large population of individuals won’t want to upgrade, and hackers are sure to be noticed.</p>  
<h4 style="font-family:verdana">What is the potential impact of this development? What is likely to change? Which people will be most affected and how? Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</h4>  

<p style="font-family:verdana">The potential impact of cybersecurity and its maintenance are evident by being familiarised with cybersecurity threats in this modern era, advanced social engineering tactics (e.g. phishing), data leak protection, and Ransomware protection.</p> 

<p style="font-family:verdana">According to a Cyber Security Breaches Survey, nearly half (43%) of all UK businesses had reported cyber security breaches or attacks in the previous 12 months that led to lost files, system, software or website corruption, and even loss of assets or intellectual property. Common cyber security threats include scammers faking a business via counterfeit emails, malware, and viruses. Also, Cyber Security Breaches Survey conducted a research, in which they found that the average financial impact for businesses in the last 12 months came at a cost of over £3,000. Lastly, General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) made businesses to report any breaches to the ICO (Information Commissioner's Office), due to the recent implementation from the GDPR. Because of this, fines have racked up enormously, which could also mean the average cost of data breaches further in the upcoming years.</p> 

<p style="font-family:verdana">Phishing refers to a process attempting to gain an individual's information to exploit the account that data is associated with, varying from banking accounts, accessing emails. During the rise of AI, criminals no longer need to be personally involved during this process but can actually automate these attacks now. For the protection of a business, the prevention of opening or responding to unexpected emails which ask for personal information must be implemented. Also, this is also supported when a business isn’t disclosing too much personal information online.</p> 

<p style="font-family:verdana">One of the most personal threats to a cybersecurity is data leaks. Businesses hold a range of data, from customer insight to employee data that often contains confidential information which can easily be disclosed if businesses don’t take care of it. One of the strategies that businesses can protect their data from any leaks is by limiting as much personal information in the public domain. Nonetheless, other ways are suggested for businesses to shrink down their personal risk of exposure is by setting up a “burner email” or an account, as it can be set up so that any replies are forwarded automatically onto the real email address, but it gives businesses the security needed, so that their email address isn’t being shared around recklessly.</p> 

<p style="font-family:verdana">Ransomware is another cybersecurity threat for businesses, which refers to type of malware that encrypts a business’ data and is only unlockable in exchange for a large payment. Businesses are choosing cloud for their data storage. From any attacks from ransomware against businesses, they should ensure that valuable data is backed up in multiple places. Also, this shouldn’t be limited to cloud services, but also on a portable hard drive or locally. It’s also crucial for businesses to keep its antivirus software updated all the time. Lastly, businesses need to ensure they invest in specific ransomware protection software that can adequately protect against a cyber-attack that includes Intercept X by Sophos, which uses deep learning malware detection to safeguard against various attacks, whilst also supporting antivirus software or existing security.</p>

<h4 style="font-family:verdana">In your daily life, how will this affect you? What will be different for you? How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</h4> 

<p style="font-family:verdana">In our everyday lives, cybersecurity can affect me, my family and friends in a positive way through financial savings, strategic benefits, a peace of mind, and a foundation for the future.</p> 

<p style="font-family:verdana">If an ongoing attack on your computer or IT infrastructure occurs, the device must be disconnected from the Internet, as this is the most effective way for the prevention of data loss. When submitting credit card data to sites that look fishy or unreliable, it can result in such liabilities. Firms that don’t practice online safety may lead to being forced to allocate a large sum of resources towards preventive measures. In order to allow such a thing, analyse the online safety’s importance, in which will help you enjoy the benefits of preventing theft and avoidance of redundant costs.</p> 

<p style="font-family:verdana">Cybercrime’s victim will be too scared in terms of searching and rely on new technologies. We are progressing rapidly towards a world where IoT (Internet of Things) will let automatic communication between machines, and big data analytics will create safer, better, and a more productive life. If cybersecurity didn’t exist, you may end up being too passive in enjoying the strategic benefits of new technologies that are beneficial.</p> 

<p style="font-family:verdana">Browsing the Internet without an antivirus program is the actual equivalent to getting hacked. Following effective cyber security rules and practices guarantees peace of mind. Very easy steps that include paying for a quality antivirus program, changing passwords and learning more about potential risks of disclosing information to phishers and hackers.</p> 

<p style="font-family:verdana">Paying attention to cyber security is the best way for the upcoming generations regarding about the importance of virtual safety. Nowadays, young individuals are at risk of cyber threats, varying from hackers trying to encourage inadvertent disclosure of private information to individuals resorting to cyber harassment or bullying. A proactive approach towards cyber security will help individuals in the future in learning lessons that will help them deal with such challenges in an excellent manner.</p>

Machine learning implements the unsupervised algorithms for the identification of particular results. Through the use of its instrumentality, machine learning makes predictions from the datasets when the only available thing is the input data, without any corresponding output variables. On the other hand, supervised algorithms work differently. The output of an algorithm that’s given is already known in supervised learning. The algorithms that are unsupervised work on AI. When the algorithms are left alone to work on its own, they discover and identify the interesting hidden patterns or groupings within a dataset which would have not been identified by using supervised algorithms. In the next upcoming years during the evolution of this, individuals will witness more improvements in unsupervised machine learning algorithms.</p>
  
<p style="font-family:verdana">Through the use of algorithms from machine learning to render augmented personalisation is an important machine learning application. They are applied to offer product recommendations to customers. Also, companies use machine learning techniques to identify an individual’s browsing activity. Using this information that was gathered, companies send product recommendations that include personalised emails and messages to their target audience. Also, machine learning techniques help in understanding consumers’ needs, wants, likes, and dislikes that keep an eye to your products and services. Because of this, it’s reported that 82% of the marketing leaders are adopting AI and machine learning for further improvement of their overall aspect. By enticing your customers to their desires, you can increase customer retention through the use of machine learning techniques is the future.</p> 
  
<p style="font-family:verdana">Cognitive services driven by machine learning are aided. Because of this, devices and applications have become more responsive. During the extensive use of cognitive services, it’s definitely going to shape the future of machine learning via trained cognitive services and certain patterns that leads to allowing the developers to include intelligent capabilities into their applications. For the part of the coders, they can install various cognitive features that include speech detection, visual recognition, and speech understanding though the use of machine learning to their apps.</p> 
  
<p style="font-family:verdana">With the increased adoption of Quantum Computing by businesses, Quantum Machine Learning algorithms have great potential that can shape the future of machine learning completely. When the quantum computers are put together into machine learning, this leads to a faster data process, in which can also provide the ability to, analyse, upgrade and draw meaningful insights from a particular dataset. This led to an expanded performance that helps businesses to achieve great results that weren’t deemed feasible using classical machine learning techniques. Nowadays, companies are exerting their effort to harness the power of quantum computing to produce techniques that are more effective. Lastly, Google and Microsoft have already announced their future plans regarding about the leverage of technology that consists of such comprehensive adoption of quantum computing, it won’t be wrong to consider it as one of the major deciding factors of the future of machine learning.</p>  
  
<h4 style="font-family:verdana">What is the potential impact of this development? What is likely to change? Which people will be most affected and how? Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</h4>

<p style="font-family:verdana">The potential impact of machine learning can impact industries that include government, marketing and sales, transportation, manufacturing and healthcare.</p>  
  
<p style="font-family:verdana">Machine learning can give the government officials an advantage to use data in order to predict future framework and to implement adjustments in terms of changing situations. Also, it can aid cybersecurity, cyber intelligence, counterterrorism attempts, logistics management, operational preparedness, the reduction of failure rates and predictive maintenance.</p> 
  
<p style="font-family:verdana">In terms of marketing and sales, machine learning is a big help in remodelling the marketing sector that led to the companies applying artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning for the expansion of customer satisfaction by over 10% successfully. Forbes states that 57% of enterprise executives give credence to the most crucial growth benefit of machine learning and AI, which is the betterment of customer support and experiences. Social media platforms and sites that include Facebook and Twitter and E-commerce are showing support by using machine learning in order to analyse the search and purchase history and making recommendations on other items to purchase that is entirely based on your past preferences and habits. Theories have speculated by experts that the future of retail is machine learning and AI driven, as deep learning businesses applications become more consummate in terms of skills that include analysing, capturing, and using data in order to personalise the individuals’ shopping experiences, so that the customised targeted marketing campaigns can be developed and implemented.</p> 
  
<p style="font-family:verdana">Transportation is also one of the factors/sectors that were helped by machine learning in terms of accuracy and efficiency, and the capability to alleviate the potential problems, which results in profitability. Also, the data analysis and modelling functions of machine learning coincide perfectly with businesses within the public transportation, delivery, and freight transport sectors. Lastly, machine learning uses algorithms to search for factors that influence a supply chain’s success, either positively and negatively that makes machine learning a crucial component within the supply chain management.</p>  
  
<p style="font-family:verdana">Machine learning has also help manufacturers and companies in terms of improvement on logistic solutions such as supply chain, assets, and inventory management. Also, machine learning plays a crucial role as one of the keys in amplifying the overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) through the use of measurement of the performance, availability and the quality of assembly equipment. Lastly, machine learning are about achieving the goal of improving the operations from a brain wave towards the final delivery, significantly reducing error rates, improving predictive maintenance, and increasing inventory turn.</p>
  
<p style="font-family:verdana">Through the implementation of wearable sensors and devices that can monitor pulse rates and steps walked to oxygen and, sleeping patterns, sugar levels have generated an eloquent volume of data, which gives doctors the ability to assess the health of their patients. This is all because of machine learning that gave benefits to overall healthcare for all individuals. Another interesting fact is that machine learning’s algorithm can analyse cancerous tumours on mammograms, retinal images for the identification of diabetic retinopathy and even skin cancer.</p>   
   
<h4 style="font-family:verdana">In your daily life, how will this affect you? What will be different for you? How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</h4> 
  
<p>In our daily lives, machine learning can affect and revolutionise me, my family and friends through the enhanced versions of health, education, law, and transportation.</p>
  
<p style="font-family:verdana">For the health component, machine learning is implemented for swift patient diagnosis and the accelerated healthcare delivery. Also, machine learning can identify the crisis and can be compared with other numerous scenarios for the right treatment. Also, machine learning can empower surgical robots, as instruments in order to help the doctors in medical procedures, whilst ensuring minimal invasion and high precision simultaneously. Through this, it is noticeable that the improvement of success rates of surgical procedures and accelerate turnaround time with cost benefits are present. Lastly, machine learning can be a crucial to detect efficient diagnosis, treatment and research, in case if I, my friends or family fell ill unexpectedly.</p>  
  
<p style="font-family:verdana">Machine learning can help assess a student’s understanding academically; it can also identify the way student gains knowledge. Because of this, it will lead to creating a customised academic plan that can help focus on the student’s particular attributes. The algorithms analyse test results and it also create a grading system that is unique, in which can free up the teachers’ time to mark exam papers and help refine the education modules for students. A bonus feature of machine learning is that it can be handy for students who are suffering with disabilities and learning gaps such as dyslexia. Lastly, machine learning can simplify administrative duties and help schools implement an organised means of administering students and staff by automated customised software and responses.</p>
  
<p style="font-family:verdana">In terms of law, machine learning is capable of developing documents, the analysation and the processing of proofs and research that results in lawyers extracting related information without having to send more time in pouring over books and legal documents. Also, machine learning can aid in systemising operational tasks that includes staying alongside with the hearings and keeping note of the impending dates. Lastly, machine learning can strategize on how will the lawyers review and speed up cases.</p>  
  
<p style="font-family:verdana">Machine learning applied the deployment of sensory management and automation, which resulted in the vehicles processing the surrounding parameter, then taking the precautionary action whenever required to ensure passenger safety as a next step. It’s reported that China is testing driverless buses for its city, whereas Rolls Royce and Google have agreed to collaborate, for the implementation of the design and to launch the world’s first self-driving ship by this year in 2020. The ship will be leveraging Google’s Cloud Machine Learning Engine to investigate its surroundings. It leads to capacitating the remote control of the vessel and reducing the resources associated inside the transportation. Beyond vehicles, machine learning can be deployed for traffic management and prevention of traffic congestions soon.</p>   

<h3 style="font-family:verdana">Autonomous Vehicles</h3>  
  
<h4 style="font-family:verdana">What is the state of the art of this new technology? What can be done now? What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)? What technological or other developments make this possible?</h4>
  
<p style="font-family:verdana">Self-driving cars are invented to reform the transportation industry. There are many noticeable shifts in the auto industry ever since the beginning of commercial auto production, which is around eight decades ago. Newly manufactured cars already have automated features that include collision and parking detection. ADS (Automated Driving Systems) for trucks, vans, and cars are on its way to go through opportunities and adjustments. This includes features like machine-corrective and machine-assisted technologies like lane correction, automated parking, and potential collision detection.</p> 
  
<p style="font-family:verdana">The examples of manufacturers that applied this are Audi and Tesla. Some manufacturers like Ford, Volvo and Baidu are already teaming up and planning to launch Level 4 autonomous vehicles next year in 2021. A Level 4 autonomous vehicle consists of carrying out all the driving functions and it doesn’t need a driver to take over in the navigation. Nonetheless, the ADS navigation’s quality can regress under particular conditions that include off-road driving or other types of hazardous situations that may lead to a human driver having the ability to control the moving vehicle. Also, Elon Musk, the founder and the CEO of Tesla have mentioned that Level 5 vehicles are ready to be launched this year in 2020. A Level 5 autonomous vehicle consists of features that include an advanced ADS system that is capable of carrying out all driving functions despite harsh conditions. However, human intervention may be compulsory to control the vehicle at times.</p> 
  
<p style="font-family:verdana">However, other industry figures and analysts have a more cautious outlook on the technology's development. This includes Steve Wozniak; the co-founder of Apple was once buoyant on the future of self-driving cars, believing that this technology is very far away from being competent.</p>
  
<p style="font-family:verdana">The ADS technology came long way, but enhancements still needs further improvement in order for Level 4 and 5 driverless cars can be sold to consumers. Lastly, the varying range of projections on when these technology advancements will arrive at the consumer level suggests that manufacturers and companies should be using different grading systems for the evaluation of the driverless cars’ overall functionality.</p>  
    
<p style="font-family:verdana">What is the potential impact of this development? What is likely to change? Which people will be most affected and how? Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</h4>
  
<p style="font-family:verdana">The potential impact of autonomous vehicles consists of economic shifts, industrial changes, changes in car insurance and driving safety, and saving time for the commuters. Research projects that the adoption of autonomous vehicles in terms of consumer life and business will have a definite impact/change on the economy.</p>
  
<p style="font-family:verdana">A study by BCG, a research group predicts that in 2035, 12 million autonomous vehicles and 18 million partially autonomous vehicles will be sold globally each year. Also, autonomous vehicles will hold 25% of the new car market, with market growth somewhere between the $42 billion and $77 billion range. Public transit drivers or taxis are jobs that are currently applied with human intervention can potentially be the outcome of autonomous vehicles operation on their own. Also, manufacturing, construction workers, and farmers could be replaced by autonomous vehicles conceivably, which are projected to do repetitive and specific tasks in those fields.</p>
  
<p style="font-family:verdana">The farming and mining industries have already adopted autonomous vehicles due to the technology becoming more affordable for them. The use of such vehicles by mining companies aids its worker safety in terms of high-risk environment through the use of taking operators out of their sections when they can be trapped in collapsing tunnels or caves. Also, the use of autonomous vehicles can save on labour costs; reduce carbon dioxide emissions as much as 60% from optimised driving. For construction, the use of loaders, forklifts and excavators can also save on labour costs and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.</p> 
  
<p style="font-family:verdana">Nowadays, consumers will be influenced in terms of how insurance companies manage and conduct their business, as insurance companies might reconsider the traditional business models. Experts have considered a way to ensuring car manufacturers against liability that leads from technical failures, that is linked with autonomous vehicles. Mercedes, Volvo, and Google are the companies that have started self-insuring the products they create.</p>  
  
<p style="font-family:verdana">A goal that was set for driverless cars is to imply a significant health and safety benefit, and they’re expected to reduce the accidents and casualties in the road. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration stated that around 35,092 individuals were killed in 2015 in automobile accidents on U.S. roads and car crashes have a considerable impact on the U.S. economy, leading to costing around $871 billion annually. Also, a recent study from McKinsey & Company, autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assistance systems have the potential to take away the motor vehicle deaths by 90%, that saves thousands of individual’s lives and roughly $190 billion annually in terms of health care figures.</p>
  
<p style="font-family:verdana">Autonomous vehicles are predicted to save time for the commuters by increasing the flow of the traffic that can lead to the travel times being reduced. Based on the U.S. Census Bureau, Americans spent a total of 29.6 billion hours commuting back in 2014, but with the help of driverless vehicles, a portion of this commute time can be used for reading, accessing, working, relaxing, entertainment and having a better life. However, there are decisions and challenges that arise before autonomous vehicles can take over that include the impact of consumers and businesses, the increased safety for the passengers and drivers, the reduced health care and the labour costs for businesses.</p>  
  
<h4 style="font-family:verdana">In your daily life, how will this affect you? What will be different for you? How might these affect members of your family or your friends?</h4>  
<p style="font-family:verdana">In our daily lives, autonomous vehicles can affect me, my family and friends through living arrangements, road accidents, and cities.</p> 
  
<p style="font-family:verdana">Based on a report on trends in U.S. real estate in 2017, MIT researchers predicted that individuals will be influenced in terms of their preferred living arrangements by autonomous cars through the choice of independent living. However, individuals who are disabled, sick, or even the elderly might face challenges because of a major change they will face is moving along because of autonomous cars. Currently, a company called “Alphabet” are testing design tools that include buttons with braille (which is a touch system that consists of reading and writing for individuals who are blind, in which raised dots represent the letters of the alphabet), in order to ensure that the impaired individuals move around with their driverless cars.</p>
  
<p style="font-family:verdana">Also, one of the mail focal points behind the production of autonomous cars is to reduce possible accidents and casualties on the road. The production of such autonomous cars is backed up through the use of sense for the detection of crossing pedestrians, signage, and traffic lanes. Also, autonomous cars will result in less pressure when drunk driving and fatigue, which leads to being relaxed and individuals can sleep at the backseat while their cars transport them back home, and will also results in a regression of needing a DUI attorney.</p>
  
<p style="font-family:verdana">Autonomous cars will have a major effect in terms of how cities are going to be built, the laws and taxes. When traffic occurs, the braking and acceleration will be reduced, which translates to fewer gridlocks. Also, cities may have to change the way their traffic lights operate. Cities will also notice adjustments in road constructions as more emphasis will be placed on pedestrians since autonomous cars move with higher precision than cars that require human intervention. Roads will equally be narrower, thereby creating more space for pedestrians and cyclists to move freely. Due to the precision of autonomous vehicles, the need for investing highly in speed cameras wouldn’t be a concern. In fact, they will always park correctly and adhere to the speed limits. Lastly, there will be a reduction in the revenue generated from the traffic fines.</p>
