<h2>IT Technologies</h2>

<h3>Clouds, services, servers</h3>

<h4>What is the state of the art of this new technology? What can be done now? What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)? What technological or other developments make this possible?</h4> 

<p>Cloud is referred as a metaphor for “the Internet”, which means a type of computing that is Internet-based computing where different services such as applications, storage, and servers are delivered to a particular organisation’s devices and computers via the Internet. Examples of cloud include Microsoft 365, Salesforce, and Adobe Creative Cloud. Cloud helps in distributing resources, which is often labelled as  “federated storage clouds” that leads to being tolerant with faults because of data distribution. Through the use of cloud, it lessens the creation of the files’ different versions because of the shared access to files, documents and data.</p>  

<p>For services regarding about cloud computing, there are three main categories, which are IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS.</p>

<p>IaaS stands for “infrastructure as a service”, which refers to the infrastructure resources that are cloud-based that is delivered to organisations through the use of virtualization technology that aids the organisations to manage and build their servers, operating systems, data storage and network. Examples of IaaS include Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS). Also, IaaS helps companies in regards to managing and building their own data as they expand, paying for server and storage space for the foundation of the software and hardware with no hosting and managing servers by themselves on-site. Lastly, the IaaS’ products make up for the structure of building new technologies via cloud.</p>  

<p>PaaS stands for “platform as a service”, which refers to the cloud-based platform services that gives the developers a scheme that they can apply to make custom applications. Examples of PaaS include OpenShift and Google App Engine. Lastly, PaaS helps developers construct custom applications online without dealing with storage, data services, and management.</p>

<p>SaaS stands for “software as a service”, which refers to a software that is cloud-based, which is hosted online by a company and it’s available for acquirement on a subscription basis and delivered through the use of internet. Examples of SaaS include Dropbox and JIRA. Also, SaaS helps distributed global teams of individuals who don’t work in terms of close physical concurrence. Also, it helps businesses to manage and use SaaS, which is also highly adaptable and wouldn’t be required to be downloaded and installed via devices to arrange it to a company or a team.</p>

<p>Cloud severs refers to a server that runs in a cloud computing environment. It’s hosted, built, and delivered through the use of cloud computing platform from the internet, which can be accessible remotely. Examples of cloud servers include Amazon elastic Compute Cloud, Google Compute Engine, Azure, HP and Microsoft Gold partnerships and Dell Premier Partner. Cloud servers help in running and functioning as independent units. Also, they help in giving users the security and stability due to the software problems are isolated from your environment. They also avoid hardware issues, which are seen with physical servers that result in being likely to be the most stable option for a business in terms of saving IT costs. Lastly, they offer scalability, which makes it quick and easier to upgrade by adding the memory and disk space.</p> 

<h4>What is the potential impact of this development? What is likely to change? Which people will be most affected and how? Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</h4>

<h4>In your daily life, how will this affect you? What will be different for you? How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</h4>

<p>Cloud computing affects me in many ways, in terms of social impact, health and many more. For social impact, if affects my daily life through the likes of YouTube and Google, which are a testimony in how individuals are interacting with others nowadays via remote locations to global centre stage. Anyone can turn into an instant reporter and news feeds that are live are being constantly streamed by the media. Even politicians and public figures are turning into engines like Twitter getting a feel of the community and by conveying their perspectives while bearing the influence and the pressure at the same time from the groups or communities that they are looking after.</p>

<p>Lastly, for health, it affects me by when either any of my family members, friends, or even myself got sick, the cloud technology in the healthcare industry is expanding its pace via the management of non-soiled patient data and can be shared among medical professionals or patients in different parties and their own status and follow-up treatments or even daily check-ups can be checked that can result in the operational costs such as data storage can be reduced. Lastly, it will be different, as there are possibilities that challenges may arise in terms of old and current tools with newer technologies and service levels, the benefits will compensate the inhibition to transfer to the cloud.</p>     
  
<h3>Cybersecurity</h3>

<h4>What is the state of the art of this new technology? What can be done now? What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)? What technological or other developments make this possible?</h4>

<p>Cybersecurity is the description of the internet-connected systems’ protection that includes software, hardware and data from cyber threats. The examples/types of cybersecurity include critical infrastructure security, application security, network security, cloud security, and Internet of things (IoT) security. Cybersecurity helps in protecting websites/networks from cyber threats that include denial-of-service attacks, malware, and hacks/viruses. Also, they keep computer systems smoothly in order to counteract the theft of personal and financial information and block intruders from gaining access and the disclosure of such data.</p> 

<h4>What is the potential impact of this development? What is likely to change? Which people will be most affected and how? Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</h4>  

<h4>In your daily life, how will this affect you? What will be different for you? How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</h4> 

<p>It will affect me, my family members, my friends and others because many of us aren’t alert of cyber-attacks that will lead to potential risks. Based on a cybersecurity firm “Kaspersky”, the attacks on mobile devices are expanding, mainly in the form of Trojans. They often disguise this malware through a selling transaction in official app stores, where it actually goes well with legitimate apps. Also, other main issues include unpatched software, which makes it easier for the malware to spread. Also, individuals don’t have the resources to easily recover from damaged attacks. As more accounts and apps are connected in this modern day, it will be more accessible for hackers to compromise apps, accounts, or cause chaos on individual’s lives, simply for entertainment.</p>

<h3>Machine Learning<h3>
  
<h4>What is the state of the art of this new technology? What can be done now? What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)? What technological or other developments make this possible?</h4>
  
<p>Machine learning refers to the application of (AI) artificial intelligence, which gives systems the capability to learn and improve from experience with no explicit programs needed automatically. It also has a focus on the computer programs’ development that gains data access. Examples of machine learning include Online Customer Support, Search Engine Result Refining, Product Recommendations, Online Fraud Detection, and Email Spam and Malware Filtering. Machine learning helps in terms of automatic learning from the computers with no human interruption needed. Lastly, machine learning algorithms give an insight and helps individuals in terms of decision making and predictions and it searches for natural patterns from the data. They’re applied daily for critical decision making such as stock trading, medical diagnosis, energy load forecasting and many more.</p>

<h3>Autonomous Vehicles</h3>  
  
<h4>What is the state of the art of this new technology? What can be done now? What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)? What technological or other developments make this possible?</h4>
  
<p>An autonomous vehicle refers to a vehicle that has the capability to operate itself by performing necessary functions with no human intervention needed through the use of detecting its surroundings. Examples of autonomous vehicles include Autonomous Electric Cars, Autonomous Self-Driving Cars, Race-Ready Autonomous Autos, Self-Parking Car Systems and Traffic Jam-Maneuvering Systems.  Autonomous vehicles help in providing advantages that can be compared to human-driven vehicles by increasing the safety on the road, as automated vehicles can potentially omit the amount of casualties as the software that are used in them are likely to commit fewer errors, contrary to humans. Because of this, it can result to a decrease in terms of the number of casualties and accidents and can also reduce traffic congestion.  Also, autonomous vehicles can help individuals who aren’t capable to drive due to factors such as disabilities, age or even fatigue in overnight journeys, as a convenient transport system.</p>

<h4>What is the potential impact of this development? What is likely to change? Which people will be most affected and how? Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</h4>
  
<p>The potential impact of autonomous vehicles consists of economic shifts, industrial changes, changes in car insurance and driving safety, and saving time for the commuters. Research projects that the adoption of autonomous vehicles in terms of consumer life and business will have a definite impact/change on the economy.</p>
  
<p>A study by BCG, a research group predicts that in 2035, 12 million autonomous vehicles and 18 million partially autonomous vehicles will be sold globally each year. Also, autonomous vehicles will hold 25% of the new car market, with market growth somewhere between the $42 billion and $77 billion range. Public transit drivers or taxis are jobs that are currently applied with human intervention can potentially be the outcome of autonomous vehicles operation on their own. Also, manufacturing, construction workers, and farmers could be replaced by autonomous vehicles conceivably, which are projected to do repetitive and specific tasks in those fields.</p>
  
<p>The farming and mining industries have already adopted autonomous vehicle due to the technology becoming more affordable for them. The use of such vehicles by mining companies aids its worker safety in terms of high-risk environment through the use of taking operators out of their sections when they can be trapped in collapsing tunnels or caves. Also, the use of autonomous vehicles can save on labour costs; reduce carbon dioxide emissions as much as 60% from optimised driving. For construction, the use of loaders, forklifts and excavators can also save on labour costs and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.</p> 
  
<p>Nowadays, consumers will be influenced in terms of how insurance companies manage and conduct their business, as insurance companies might reconsider the traditional business models. Experts have considered a way to ensuring car manufacturers against liability that leads from technical failures, that is linked with autonomous vehicles. Mercedes, Volvo, and Google are the companies that have started self-insuring the products they create.</p>  
  
<p>A goal that was set for driverless cars is to imply a significant health and safety benefit, and they’re expected to reduce the accidents and casualties in the road. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration stated that around 35,092 individuals were killed in 2015 in automobile accidents on U.S. roads and car crashes have a considerable impact on the U.S. economy, leading to costing around $871 billion annually. Also, a recent study from McKinsey & Company, autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assistance systems have the potential to take away the motor vehicle deaths by 90%, that saves thousands of individual’s lives and roughly $190 billion annually in terms of health care figures.</p>
  
<p>Autonomous vehicles are predicted to save time for the commuters by increasing the flow of the traffic that can lead to the travel times being reduced. Based on the U.S. Census Bureau, Americans spent a total of 29.6 billion hours commuting back in 2014, but with the help of driverless vehicles, a portion of this commute time can be used for reading, accessing, working, relaxing, entertainment and having a better life. However, there are decisions and challenges that arise before autonomous vehicles can take over that include the impact of consumers and businesses, the increased safety for the passengers and drivers, the reduced health care and the labour costs for businesses.</p>  
  
<h4>In your daily life, how will this affect you? What will be different for you? How might these affect members of your family or your friends?</h4>  
  
<p>In our daily lives, autonomous vehicles can affect me, my family and friends through living arrangements, the impact on the job market, businesses and on road accidents, and in our health systems.</p> 
  
<p>Based on a report on trends in U.S. real estate in 2017, MIT researchers predicted that individuals will be influenced in terms of their preferred living arrangements by autonomous cars through the choice of independent living. However, individuals who are disabled, sick, or even the elderly might face challenges because of a major change they will face is moving along because of autonomous cars. Currently, a company called “Alphabet” are testing design tools that include buttons with braille (which is a touch system that consists of reading and writing for individuals who are blind, in which raised dots represent the letters of the alphabet), in order to ensure that the impaired individuals move around with their driverless cars.</p>
  
<p>Andrea Tschiesner, a Senior Partner at McKinsey & Company describes the effect of the autonomous cars will have on the economy/job market. His research consists of a saying that there will be not only a reduction in train and bus drivers, but also individuals who are civil servants who are located at traffic departments. This may be perceives as bad news, but Tschiesner provided comfort through the adaptation of autonomous vehicles in cities that will result in a growth of employment demands of scientists and even cleaners.</p>
  
<p>Businesses, especially local businesses can take the location-based services as an opportunity in order to produce personalised and location-specific advertising. For instance, every time a worker has to input their particular location into an autonomous car. Also, one of the major points stated is how individuals will be able to input productive activities into their commuting time. For example, imagine a scenario where a worker has to spend 30 minutes commuting to work on a daily basis, and he decides to use half of that time to go through his emails, shop online, or go through his mail, which will benefits businesses.</p>
  
<p>Also, one of the mail focal points behind the production of autonomous cars.....</p>
