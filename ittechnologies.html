<p>Cloud is referred as a metaphor for “the Internet”, which means a type of computing that is Internet-based computing where different services such as applications, storage, and servers are delivered to a particular organisation’s devices and computers via the Internet. Examples of cloud include Microsoft 365, Salesforce, and Adobe Creative Cloud. Cloud helps in distributing resources, which is often labelled as  “federated storage clouds” that leads to being tolerant with faults because of data distribution. Through the use of cloud, it lessens the creation of the files’ different versions because of the shared access to files, documents and data.</p>  

<p>For services regarding about cloud computing, there are three main categories, which are IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS.</p>

<p>IaaS stands for “infrastructure as a service”, which refers to the infrastructure resources that are cloud-based that is delivered to organisations through the use of virtualization technology that aids the organisations to manage and build their servers, operating systems, data storage and network. Examples of IaaS include Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS). Also, IaaS helps companies in regards to managing and building their own data as they expand, paying for server and storage space for the foundation of the software and hardware with no hosting and managing servers by themselves on-site. Lastly, the IaaS’ products make up for the structure of building new technologies via cloud.</p>  

<p>PaaS stands for “platform as a service”, which refers to the cloud-based platform services that gives the developers a scheme that they can apply to make custom applications. Examples of PaaS include OpenShift and Google App Engine. Lastly, PaaS helps developers construct custom applications online without dealing with storage, data services, and management.</p>

<p>SaaS stands for “software as a service”, which refers to a software that is cloud-based, which is hosted online by a company and it’s available for acquirement on a subscription basis and delivered through the use of internet. Examples of SaaS include Dropbox and JIRA. Also, SaaS helps distributed global teams of individuals who don’t work in terms of close physical concurrence. Also, it helps businesses to manage and use SaaS, which is also highly adaptable and wouldn’t be required to be downloaded and installed via devices to arrange it to a company or a team.</p>

<p>Cloud severs refers to a server that runs in a cloud computing environment. It’s hosted, built, and delivered through the use of cloud computing platform from the internet, which can be accessible remotely. Examples of cloud servers include Amazon elastic Compute Cloud, Google Compute Engine, Azure, HP and Microsoft Gold partnerships and Dell Premier Partner. Cloud servers help in running and functioning as independent units. Also, they help in giving users the security and stability due to the software problems are isolated from your environment. They also avoid hardware issues, which are seen with physical servers that result in being likely to be the most stable option for a business in terms of saving IT costs. Lastly, they offer scalability, which makes it quick and easier to upgrade by adding the memory and disk space.</p>
