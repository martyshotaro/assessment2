<h4 style="font-family:verdana">1st video – Software Engineer by Gyasi Linje</h4>

<h4 style="font-family:verdana"> •	What kind of work is done by the IT professional?</h4>
  
<p style="font-family:verdana">The kind of work that’s done by this IT professional include checking emails, eating breakfast sometimes after clocking in, meeting with interns, web meetings, coding (doing it after or before breaks, sometimes in between), and designing/editing computer software.</p> 

<h4 style="font-family:verdana"> •	What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are there other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?</h4>

<p style="font-family:verdana">Based on the video, he interacted with the interns, and other workers. During the meeting, even if it didn’t mention the people he went in a meeting with, but I’m sure that they are meeting with potential clients, along with other workers from different IT professions at the same company and workplace.</p>     
  
<h4 style="font-family:verdana"> •	Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</h4>

<p style="font-family:verdana">In this video, he spent a lot of time coding, being with interns for some of his working hours for assistance and possibly mentorship, and he has the most break time I’ve seen from a software engineer ever, or any IT professions in general.</p>  
  
<h4 style="font-family:verdana"> •	What aspect of their position is most challenging?</h4>

<p style="font-family:verdana">I think the most challenging aspect in terms of being a software engineer includes being consistent will all the tasks that need to be done in a limited time that include coding, designing, organising or going to meetings, answering unchecked emails, and many more. Also, other challenges that may arise as a software engineer include debugging, integration (when integrations don’t reveal during the process of the development), and security/operational challenges.</p>

<h4 style="font-family:verdana"> •	What kind of work is done by the IT professional?</h4>

<p style="font-family:verdana">The kind of work that’s done by this IT professional include checking emails after clocking in and out, having an internal social network by his company for updates, having a quick breakfast and lunch, and coding and designing a software in a particular programming language (in the video, he’s coding and designing via “Startup.cs” on ASP.NET Core). Also, he attends the first scrum meeting (twice in the video), which were hosted by developers and other workers, regarding about what they have programmed the previous days, daily tasks, and tackling problems for the future. The last scrum meeting that they had, they tackled about the final reviews of current and potential projects, which sum up the day.</p>

<h4 style="font-family:verdana"> •	What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are there other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?</h4>  

<p style="font-family:verdana">He interacts with the host of the video for the most of the time for the host to know what he does in a daily basis as a Japanese programmer. Also, he interacted with the other developers and other workers in the two scrum meetings, and game executives (in the video, the game executives of Code Vein and Tekken7 are present in the video). Also, he interacted with one of his co-workers that he went lunch with. Lastly, there was an interaction with him and one of the workers in a different department (in this case, in a finance department) to discuss about expenses.</p> 
 
<h4 style="font-family:verdana"> •	Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</h4>

<p style="font-family:verdana">In this particular video, he spent most of his time in designing and coding a particular programming language, and also attending two scrum meetings that were split up from different times. The scrum meetings were spearheaded by other developers and workers. Lastly, he spend most of his time interacting with the host throughout the majority of the video, that discusses what he does in a daily basis as a programmer located in Japan.</p>
  
<h4 style="font-family:verdana"> •	What aspect of their position is most challenging?</h4> 

<p style="font-family:verdana">I think the most challenging aspects in terms of being a programmer include long hours or lack of outputs, specific time estimation for particular tasks that needs to be done, and sometimes you will come across with days that you or they lack communication skills, and maybe it’s due to sorts of misunderstandings in a workplace setting.</p>
