<h4 style="font-family:verdana"> •	What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are there other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?</h4>

<p style="font-family:verdana">Based on the video, he interacted with the interns, and other workers. During the meeting, even if it didn’t mention the people he went in a meeting with, but I’m sure that they are meeting with potential clients, along with other workers from different IT professions at the same company and workplace.</p>     
  
<h4 style="font-family:verdana"> •	Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</h4>

<p style="font-family:verdana">In this video, he spent a lot of time coding, being with interns for some of his working hours for assistance and possibly mentorship, and he has the most break time I’ve seen from a software engineer ever, or any IT professions in general.</p>  
  
<h4 style="font-family:verdana"> •	What aspect of their position is most challenging?</h4>

<p style="font-family:verdana">I think the most challenging aspect in terms of being a software engineer includes being consistent will all the tasks that need to be done in a limited time that include coding, designing, organising or going to meetings, answering unchecked emails, and many more. Also, other challenges that may arise as a software engineer include debugging, integration (when integrations don’t reveal during the process of the development), and security/operational challenges.</p>

<h4 style="font-family:verdana"> •	What aspect of their position is most challenging?</h4> 

<p style="font-family:verdana">I think the most challenging aspects in terms of being a programmer include long hours or lack of outputs, specific time estimation for particular tasks that needs to be done, and sometimes you will come across with days that you or they lack communication skills, and maybe it’s due to sorts of misunderstandings in a workplace setting.</p>

<p style="font-family:verdana">Based on the data administrator’s interview for “careersnz”, the most challenging aspect of being a data administrator is that when the system of the data is running slow, (or what’s even worse is that it’s shut down), there are major side effects that include customers, workers, internal staff are in jeopardy within the organisation, as the database system is the sole reason why a company or an organisation exists in the first place.

<p style="font-family:verdana">The kind of work that’s done by this IT professional includes receiving customer encounter problems such as complaints from the call centre (or Helpdesk) by creating a ticketing system for that specific customer. Also, they make appointments with the customer form their preferred date and time, and when the technician arrives, the technician starts troubleshooting.

<p style="font-family:verdana">The hardest aspect of being an IT technician is the troubleshooting aspect of IT. As you can see in the video, he opens the CPU to see what’s wrong, so that he can start troubleshooting. It didn’t work at first and it took him a bit of time to figure it out. However, he took a different approach of troubleshooting by replacing one of the CPU components for the customer’s computer to start running successfully. In general, sometimes troubleshooting can take a long time, or it can also stop working due to your profile and system being corrupted. In order for your computer to work, you must create a new user and check if the same issue occurs again.</p>
