<h4 style="font-family:verdana">1st video – Software Engineer by Gyasi Linje</h4>

<h4 style="font-family:verdana"> •	What kind of work is done by the IT professional?</h4>
  
<p style="font-family:verdana">The kind of work that’s done by this IT professional include checking emails, eating breakfast sometimes after clocking in, meeting with interns, web meetings, coding (doing it after or before breaks, sometimes in between), and designing/editing computer software.</p> 

<h4 style="font-family:verdana"> •	What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are there other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?</h4>

<p style="font-family:verdana">Based on the video, he interacted with the interns, and other workers. During the meeting, even if it didn’t mention the people he went in a meeting with, but I’m sure that they are meeting with potential clients, along with other workers from different IT professions at the same company and workplace.</p>     
  
<h4 style="font-family:verdana"> •	Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</h4>

<p style="font-family:verdana">In this video, he spent a lot of time coding, being with interns for some of his working hours for assistance and possibly mentorship, and he has the most break time I’ve seen from a software engineer ever, or any IT professions in general.</p>
