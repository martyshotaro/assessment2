<h4>What do the results of this test mean for you?</h4>

<p>This result means to me, as it is an eye opener personally because it shows the results that I wasn’t expecting. It also shows the percentage of each traits mentioned, which will help me in terms of how I would act, behave, and take part within a workplace. Based on the results, I found out that my personality type is somewhat unique, as this could bring diversity and another arsenal in terms of different personality types in a workplace. I wasn’t also expecting that my personality type consists of excellent analytical abilities; though reserved, they have well-developed people skills and strong social relationships. Also, Defenders like me are truly benefactors, where kindness meets together that engages other workmates to believe the process inside the workplace, with generosity and enthusiasm. However, despite being a generally a conservative type, Defenders are often receptive to change. As with so many things, other individuals with the Defender personality type like myself are more than the sum of their parts, and it’s a strategy they apply as strengths that defines who they are.</p>

<h4>How do you think this result may influence your behaviour in a team?</h4>

<p>My profile results may affect my behaviour when it comes to my team is due to my personality type, which is a defender has some disadvantages. These include taking things too personally, defenders do have a trouble when it comes to differentiating and separating impersonal and personal situations, which can lead to possible conflicts. Lastly, any negativity from conflict or criticism can carry over from their personal and professional lives. Also, the repression their feelings; defenders are more sensitive and private, which incorporates their feelings at a great deal. They must protect their own feelings and the inability to convey healthy emotional expressions can result in a lot of stress and frustration, even amongst your team members. Also, being reluctance to change can influence/affect behaviour in a tem within a workplace due to their history and traditions of value in their decisions in a highly manner. These challenges can be especially hard to address, as a situation sometimes needs to reach the breaking point before being convinced by circumstance.<p>

<h4>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h4>

<p>These traits can possibly be taken into consideration when it comes to forming a team by when taking things too personally, don’t jump to conclusions too quickly when you are being confronted, don’t make such assumptions about criticism or judgement all being directed to you. Maybe it’s not all about you, but about the ones judging and confronting you from their own viewpoint. Even though defenders are sensitive and private, they should practice daily mindfulness. It’s one of the best tools to pull yourself away from your reactive thoughts and into the present moment as it leaves your mind clearer and calmer that leads to increasing your self-esteem. Also, it enhances your physical/mental health as it can relieve stress, lower your blood pressure, reduce chronic pain, improve your sleep and it treats substance abuse, depression, and other anxiety orders.</p>

<h4>What do the results of this test mean for you?</h4>

<p>	Personally, the results above indicate the percentage of each traits mentioned is an eye-opener that will determine in terms of how I would act, behave, and take part within a workplace, in which will also help me. Based on the results, I found out that my personality types are the following, activists, pragmatists, reflectors, and theorists in different percentages and matches of course. Those are the four personal learning styles in a workplace, which could bring different ranges of personality types within a workplace. For activists, they’re more like to immerse themselves fully in terms of experiencing new things. They tend to be more enthusiastic, flexible and open-minded. Also, they tend to be the first ones to act and consider the consequences later. Learning methods suitable for activists include brainstorming, roleplaying, group discussion and problem setting. For pragmatists, they need the ability to view learning into practice in real life situations that include abstract concepts and games have limitations in terms of usage unless they have brainstormed and put those ideas into action. Lastly, they may act fast on ideas, and always straight to the point. Learning methods that suit pragmatists are practicals, problem setting, discussions and case studies. For reflectors, this style of personality tends to be more relaxed, observe and cautious. They also prefer to analyse and gather information in order to help reach their conclusions. Also, they see the bigger picture by utilising information that they collected from previous experiences, also the ones from present. The learning methods associated with reflectors includes self-analysis questionnaires, paired discussions, demonstrations, coaching and feedback from others. Lastly, for theorists, they would rather think problems logically, value objectivity and rationality and they like to assimilate unalike theories into reasonable theories. Also, they are disciplined and they aim to fit things into a rational order. They are also into principles, theories and basic assumptions. The learning methods associated with theorists include classroom response systems, quotes, tutorials, story telling and models.</p> 
  
<h4>How do you think this result may influence your behaviour in a team?</h4>

<p>My profile results may affect my behaviour when it comes to my team is due to my personality types that matched with this online learning style test that has noticeable disadvantages. For activists, they tend to do too much tasks themselves, which carries too much load in terms of the tasks and objectives ahead of them. Also, they tend to take risks that are unnecessary, get bored with consolidation and implementation and they take action with no valid preparation. For pragmatists, they tend to jump into solutions that are practical without thinking regarding about the conceptual underpinning or a better creative approach. For reflectors, they hold back from direct participation. Also, they’re not quick in terms of decision-making, they tend to be too careful, which leads to taking minimal risks and they are not decisive/dominant. Lastly for theorists, they clash creativity with problems. Also, the time spent on planning is too long, and the inability to apply theoretical aspects in real life situations.</p>
  
<h4>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h4>
  
<p>These traits can possibly taken into consideration when it comes to forming a team by these tips as follows. Activists should adapt on embracing new situations, being optimistic regarding about new things, enjoying the company of small group discussions and being highly sociable. Pragmatists are expected to put new ideas that they have provided into practice, or in other words, the attitude of liking to implement what one has learned. Reflectors must be methodical and thoughtful, be a good listener; they also shouldn’t jump into conclusions, and the use of such tools that include brainstorming and journals. Lastly, theorists must be objective, think things in a logical manner, they must go through that rational approach, and they must like tools that include readings, case studies and models.<p>

<h4>What do the results of this test mean for you?</h4>
  
<p>First of all, the results above indicate the percentage of each traits mentioned demonstrates my actions and behaviour in a team within a workplace. The results state that I have a high level of agreeableness (91%), emotional stability (74%), and conscientiousness (76%). Also, I have a medium level of extroversion (63%) and a low level of intellect/imagination (59%). Those are the four personal learning styles in a workplace, which could bring different ranges of personality types within a workplace.</p>
<p>For agreeableness, individuals who scored a high level of agreeableness can tend to perform well in interpersonal interactions such as customer service through their good use of communication and language. Also, they learn how to avoid conflicts and engaging in such nonsense fights, and they tend to be higher in terms of conformity and will adapt to a company culture better.</p>
<p>For emotional stability, individuals who score a high level of emotional stability can tend to be calm and steady. They also react less emotionally and can’t get upset that easily, which leads to not constantly experiencing negative feelings towards others.</p> 
<p>For conscientiousness, individuals who score a high level of conscientiousness can tend to be empathetic and mindful towards other individuals in a workplace. Also, they are conscious of the first impression that they make on others when they are being introduced.

<h4>How do you think this result may influence your behaviour in a team?</h4> 
  
<p>My profile results may affect my behaviour when it comes to my team is due to my personality type, which is a defender has some disadvantages.</p>
<p>Individuals who are extroverted tend to struggle to monitor their emotions in check. They may come across as aggressive sometimes, but this can result in unfinished projects and being easily controlled by the opinions of others. Also, they may lack emotional and analytical judgements, and they have the tendency to spend time in the company of others, which leads to their personal work being affected.</p>
<p>Individuals who are emotionally stable may tend to lack levels of creativity and innovation potential. Creativity is associated with such traits that are characteristic of low EQ that includes artistic moodiness, hostile impulsivity, and nonconformism.  It’s also challenging to build relations and working with others who have low levels of nonconformity, which can result to challenge the status quo and replace it with something unfamiliar.</p>
<p>Individuals who are high in agreeableness can tend to care about what others think that leads them to have the drive to please others. Lastly, this may result in the neglecting of their own needs just to meet other’s needs/preferences. They also have the inability to say no.</p>
<p>Conscientiousness exposes positive relations with such psychological wellbeing and conceptual work advices that individuals can be too conscientious that leads to an obsessive-compulsiveness behaviour and less positive outcomes individually in a workplace.</p>  
<p>Imaginations can lead you to take such risks of spending more time in your imaginary ideas than actually implementing it in real life situations. It can also lead to a social disconnection and it creates a barrier if you allow fantasy to strip our attention since it’s necessary for general understanding. Lastly, being too intellect can sometimes be too impatient that leaves your level on patience being questioned, if it’s as high as your IQ. Also, little achievements in a workplace can be left unnoticed, and you tend to being controlled by your brain more than your heart, which can lead to lack of empathy and feelings.</p>
  
<h4>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h4> 
  
<p>These traits can possibly taken into consideration when it comes to forming a team by these tips as follows.</p> 
<p>Individuals who are extroverted should have the ability to form close associations with others in a workplace. They can also work well in terms of group settings, which lead to their ideas and comments being well received in a workplace.

<p>Individuals who have such levels of conscientiousness are expected to be more responsible as it links to such aspects within a workplace that include performance, physical health and general wellbeing. They are also expected to lower the likelihood of absenteeism and procrastination.</p> 
<p>Lastly, individuals who have good imagination/intellectual skills are expected to be more optimistic.
