<h3 style="font-family:verdana">Team Profile Results</h3>

<h4 style="font-family:verdana">Results of an online Myers-Briggs test</h4>  

<img src="turbulent.jpg">

<img src="turbulent2.jpg" width="515">

<p style="font-family:verdana"> - Personality type is a Turbulent Architect: INTJ-T</p>
<p style="font-family:verdana"> - Mind (42% extraverted, 58% introverted)</p>
<p style="font-family:verdana"> - Energy (67% intuitive, 33% observant)</p>
<p style="font-family:verdana"> - Tactics (68% thinking, 32% feeling)</p>
<p style="font-family:verdana"> - Nature (53% judging, 47% prospecting)</p>
<p style="font-family:verdana"> - Identity (42% assertive, 58% turbulent)</p>
  
<h4 style="font-family:verdana">What do the results of this test mean for you?</h4>

<p style="font-family:verdana">It shows me that I have the ability to think and perhaps overthink. I am leaning towards introversion, but it seems I am close to middle ground there. I mostly judge/analyse and tend to expect individuals to see my point of view; sometimes this may be a downfall as I expect others to be on my path and my pace. It is difficult for me to emphasize, not necessarily because I don’t have an interest, but more particularly due to misunderstanding.</p>

<h4 style="font-family:verdana">How do you think this result may influence your behaviour in a team?</h4>

<p style="font-family:verdana">The results show me that working in a team is definitely possible, considering my introversion and extraversion seems to be middle ground. However, I do prefer to work separately when actually completing a task as I get distracted working with others. The separation of work within a team allows me to easily mould into a team environment for a group assignment for example. I like to coordinate efforts to achieve a mutual objective; in this case, reaching for a high mark.<p>

<h4 style="font-family:verdana">How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h4>

<p style="font-family:verdana">There isn’t too much to take into account. The group assignment is completed online with communication regarding parts of the assessment. I do enjoy helping others, so if parts of the assignment need help from my end, I am gladly able to.</p>

<h4 style="font-family:verdana">Results of the 123test</h4>

<img src="edward123test.jpg">
  
<h4 style="font-family:verdana">What do the results of this test mean for you?</h4>

<p style="font-family:verdana">The IQ test is a basic and free test I found on the internet. To me, it is a general understanding of how my brain works and what type of tasks suit my strengths. I do notice that my pattern recognition and logical reasoning is far greater than my creativity and comprehension for example.</p> 

<h4 style="font-family:verdana">How do you think this result may influence your behaviour in a team?</h4>

<p style="font-family:verdana">I believe these results have no effect on my behaviour in a team. I am able to complete many tasks, but there are many areas where I have weaknesses. The IQ test is a great way of understanding logic and reasoning, but it does not reflect my emotional intelligence. Perhaps, this is a flaw and may affect my behaviour in a team, but in the past, I have had no issue cooperating in a team.</p> 

<h4 style="font-family:verdana">How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h4>

<p style="font-family:verdana">When forming a team, I do not believe this has any effect, as an IQ level really does not hinder the formation of a team from my end.</p>

<h4 style="font-family:verdana">Results of the Personality Max test</h4>

<img src="personalitymax.jpg">

<img src="personalitymax1.jpg">

<p style="font-family:verdana"> - Visual (39%)</p>
<p style="font-family:verdana"> - Kinesthetic (33%)</p>
<p style="font-family:verdana"> - Auditory (28%)</p>   

<h4 style="font-family:verdana">What do the results of this test mean for you?</h4>

<p style="font-family:verdana">Being a visual learner is correct. I do enjoy learning via methods of hearing, seeing and doing. Listening isn’t my strongest skill when it comes to learning. I do prefer to see examples being written out and performing the tasks on my own (whilst asking for help, of course).</p>

<h4 style="font-family:verdana">How do you think this result may influence your behaviour in a team?</h4>  
  
<p style="font-family:verdana">Regarding a team, seeing the work handed in by a group is effective for me. I am able to see the completed work and assess where I am confused or perhaps where I would be able to help improve parts of the work.</p>

<h4 style="font-family:verdana">How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h4>  
  
<p style="font-family:verdana">When forming a team it isn’t so necessary to take into account being a visual learner. Observing the work complete by the rest of the team is a strength for me and therefore I do not see it hindering my ability to reside in a group.</p>
