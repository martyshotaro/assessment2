<h3>Team Profile Results:</h3>

<h4>Results of an online Myers-Briggs test</h4>  

<p> - Personality type is a Turbulent Architect: INTJ-T
<p> - Mind (42% extraverted, 58% introverted)
<p> - Energy (67% intuitive, 33% observant)
<p> - Tactics (68% thinking, 32% feeling)
<p> - Nature (53% judging, 47% prospecting)
<p> - Identity (42% assertive, 58% turbulent)
  
<h4>What do the results of this test mean for you?</h4>

<p>It shows me that I have the ability to think and perhaps overthink. I am leaning towards introversion, but it seems I am close to middle ground there. I mostly judge/analyse and tend to expect individuals to see my point of view; sometimes this may be a downfall as I expect others to be on my path and my pace. It is difficult for me to emphasize, not necessarily because I don’t have an interest, but more particularly due to misunderstanding.</p>

<h4>How do you think this result may influence your behaviour in a team?</h4>

<p>The results show me that working in a team is definitely possible, considering my introversion and extraversion seems to be middle ground. However, I do prefer to work separately when actually completing a task as I get distracted working with others. The separation of work within a team allows me to easily mould into a team environment for a group assignment for example. I like to coordinate efforts to achieve a mutual objective; in this case, reaching for a high mark.<p>

<h4>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h4>

<p>There isn’t too much to take into account. The group assignment is completed online with communication regarding parts of the assessment. I do enjoy helping others, so if parts of the assignment need help from my end, I am gladly able to.</p>
