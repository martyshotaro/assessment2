<p style="font-family:verdana">My job title for my ideal job is a system admin in IT support and Edward’s job title for his ideal job is an investment adviser in Equities and Derivatives. Based on the U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics, the demands in employment is quite a big leap, as employment of network and computer systems administrators are expected to grow 4% from 2019 to 2029, as fast as the average for all occupations. The demand for IT workers is high and expected to expand as firms take their time to invest in faster and newer technology and mobile networks. Nonetheless, the growth of cloud computing might expand its productivity of network/systems admins that will result in slowing down their employment growth from many different varying industries.</p> 
   
<p style="font-family:verdana">Also based on the U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics, it’s quite enormous as investment advisers are projected to grow from 2019 to 2029, as fast as average. During the growth of the population/life/age expectancies, the assumptions of demand for financial planning services should increase. The main focal point of employment growth is the aging population, as the large amount of baby boomers approach retirement and longer lifespans will result to longer retirement periods that will increase the demand for investment advisers.  Also, companies don’t offer pension plans as much nowadays. Therefore, individuals are expected to save up and invest for their retirement that will lead to the increasing demand for investment advisers.</p>
