<h4>What are the Job Titles for your group's ideal jobs? How do each of these ranks in terms of demand from employers?</h4>

<h4>From your group's ideal jobs, you can identify a set of skills required for these jobs (we will refer to this as your group's
required skill set). These can be divided into general skills (communication, problem solving, writing etc) and IT-specific skills (Javascript, SQL, etc).</h4>

<h4> - How do the IT-specific skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</h4>

<h4> - How do the general skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</h4>

<h4> - What are the three highest ranked IT-specific skills, which are not in your required skill set?</h4>

<h4> - What are the three highest ranked general skills, which are not in your required skill set?</h4>
